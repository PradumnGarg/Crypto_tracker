# bitcoin_tracker

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

It helps us to get real time values of Bitcoin, Etherium and Litecoin in 20 different currencies. The solution is extensible and hence can be applied for other altcoins like doge,shiba etc . Not much focus is given to UI/UX because the project was built to make use of several flutter packages like convert,io etc. Some user interface provided is platform dependent and so will be renderend accordingly.

Below are the screenshots of the same:-
